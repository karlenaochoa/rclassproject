# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis

# Results

##Plot 1

```{r plot1 }
summary_plot <- data %>%
  group_by(age_group, condition) %>%
  summarize(average_trust = mean(total_trust))
  
ggplot(summary_plot, aes(age_group, average_trust)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = condition), position = "dodge", alpha = .7) +
    labs(title = "Children's Selective Trust of Helpful over Tricky informant" , 
       subtitle = " Separated by Condition and Age group ", 
       x = "Age Group", 
       y = "Average Trust Score") +
  theme_minimal()

# plot1 is straightforward and delivers clear message.
# For styling, I place spaces around all infix operators.
```

##Plot 2

```{r plot2}

summary_plot2 <- data_tidy %>% 
  group_by(subid) %>%
  summarize(average_csus = mean(csus_response), 
            average_trust = mean(total_trust)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(average_csus))

ggplot(summary_plot2, aes(average_trust, average_csus)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Relation between CSUS Response and Children's Trust Score" , 
       subtitle = " CSUS response is parents' response on Children's Theory of Mind", 
       x = "Average Trust Score", 
       y = "Average CSUS Response") +
  theme_minimal()

# plot2 is straightforward and delivers clear message. 
# I especially appreciate you use subtitle to explain the abbreviation.
# For styling, I place spaces around all infix operators.

# summary ------------------------------------------------

# Code is efficient, corret and minimal.
# Coding style has some errors but is totally readable.
# Graphs carefully tuned for desired purpose.
# Codes runs after changing eval = FALSE to TRUE.
# I expect to see the table(s) and text content !

# end of peer review -------------------------------------
